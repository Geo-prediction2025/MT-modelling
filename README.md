This code is implemented based on MATLAB R2016a and is used for calculating the three-dimensional numerical simulation of MT with first type boundary conditions and mixed boundary conditions, taking into account the influence of anisotropy.
The code description is as follows in test files.


<h1>Installation from github</h1>

If you want to access the source code and potentially contribute. You should follow the following steps.
<h2>1. Download</h2>

Download 3D MT-modelling from the Github repository: https://github.com/Geo-prediction2025/MT-modelling.git.

<h2>2. Install software MATLAB R2016a </h2>
The specific installation steps can be found on the Matlab official website. This software is easy to install and implement.
